/*
At consensus, updates the fields of a smart contract to the given values.

If no value is given for a field, that field is left unchanged on the contract. For an immutable smart contract (that is, a contract created without an adminKey), only the expirationTime may be updated; setting any other field in this case will cause the transaction status to resolve to MODIFYING_IMMUTABLE_CONTRACT.

--- Signing Requirements ---
1. Whether or not a contract has an adminKey, its expirationTime can be extended with only the transaction payer's signature.
2. Updating any other field of a mutable contract requires the adminKey's signature.
3. If the update transaction includes a new adminKey, this new key must also sign. */
